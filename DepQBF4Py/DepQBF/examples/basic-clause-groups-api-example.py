# The API file 'DepQBF.py' has some comments regarding the usage of
# the API.  The header file 'qdpll.h' has some comments regarding the
# usage of the API.
#
# Please see also the file 'basic-api-example.py' for more
# comments. The example below is similar to 'basic-api-example.py' but
# it does not make use of the push/pop API functions. Instead, clauses
# are added to and deleted from the formula based on selector
# variables. The selector variables are existentially quantified in
# the leftmost quantifier block. Each added clause gets a selector
# variable, which is assigned as an assumption before the actual
# solving starts. This way, clauses are enabled and disabled by
# selector variables. We argue that the use of the push/pop API
# functions is less error-prone from the user's perspective.
